    "# 1. What is a constructor in Python? Explain its purpose and usage.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. \n",
    "The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. \n",
    "In Python, the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when an object is created\n",

    "\n",
    "def __init__(self):\n",
    "    # body of the constructor\n",
    "    \n",
    "Advantages of using constructors in Python:\n",
    "1. Initialization of objects: Constructors are used to initialize the objects of a class. They allow you to set default values for attributes or properties, and also allow you to initialize the object with custom data.\n",
    "2. Easy to implement: Constructors are easy to implement in Python, and can be defined using the __init__() method.\n",
    "3. Better readability: Constructors improve the readability of the code by making it clear what values are being initialized and how they are being initialized.\n",
    "4. Encapsulation: Constructors can be used to enforce encapsulation, by ensuring that the object’s attributes are initialized correctly and in a controlled manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of using constructors in Python:\n",
    "1. Overloading not supported: Unlike other object-oriented languages, Python does not support method overloading. This means that you cannot have multiple constructors with different parameters in a single class.\n",
    "2. Limited functionality: Constructors in Python are limited in their functionality compared to constructors in other programming languages. For example, Python does not have constructors with access modifiers like public, private or protected.\n",
    "3. Constructors may be unnecessary: In some cases, constructors may not be necessary, as the default values of attributes may be sufficient. In these cases, using a constructor may add unnecessary complexity to the code."

    "Information hiding is a software design principle closely related to encapsulation. It emphasizes the need to hide implementation details of a class or module from the external world, exposing only essential interfaces. This approach helps manage the complexity of a system, promotes code modularity, and protects sensitive data. Information hiding plays a vital role in ensuring software security, maintainability, and flexibility.\n",

    "1. List ADT\n",
    "get() – Return an element from the list at any given position.\n",

    "# 17. Discuss the benefits of using abstraction in large-scale software development projects.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "There are a few recommended practices that can help optimize the advantages of abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) and raise the overall caliber of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main guidelines for employing abstraction are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use abstraction to hide implementation details: One of abstraction's main goals is to conceal how classes, methods, or data structures are actually implemented internally. You give the consumers of your code a streamlined and high-level view by encapsulating the complexity into abstract classes, interfaces, or abstract functions. This division of duties enhances the organization, security, and maintainability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use Abstraction to improve readability and maintainability of code: Use abstraction to develop clear, succinct interfaces that concentrate on crucial behaviors and functionalities. Abstraction enables you to design code that is easier to read and maintain. The code is made easier to read and understand by abstracting away pointless details. A further benefit of abstraction is that it encourages modular architecture, which makes it simpler to update and maintain code over time. A well-designed abstraction should be simple to understand and maintain, improving the codebase's overall readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use abstraction to make code less difficult: By offering high-level interfaces and obscuring sophisticated implementation details, abstraction makes code usage simpler. Abstraction lessens the cognitive load on users and makes the code more manageable by concentrating on the fundamental traits and behaviors. It prevents developers from being overburdened with needless complexity and enables them to think more abstractly. As a result, the code is simpler, less prone to errors, and simpler to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use abstraction to encourage code reuse: Abstraction encourages code reuse by establishing generic interfaces or abstract classes that can be used by various classes to extend or implement them. You can reduce waste and increase efficiency by encapsulating common behaviors or attributes in abstract classes or interfaces. Instead of starting from scratch every time, reuse existing abstractions to speed up development, assure consistency throughout the codebase, and prevent inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use abstraction to make code more adaptable and flexible: Abstraction makes code more adaptable and flexible. You can improve or modify the internal details without impacting the external code that depends on them by separating the abstraction from its implementation. This adaptability makes it simpler to include new features, technological advancements, or requirement adjustments. A stable contract or interface provided by well-designed abstractions protects users from underlying changes, making the code more durable and adaptable\n",

    "# 18. Explain how abstraction enhances code reusability and modularity in Python program\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Abstraction is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that includes hiding extraneous information and reflecting only the essential characteristics of an object or system. This method has a number of advantages that improve the overall efficacy and efficiency of software development. The advantages of abstraction in OOP are detailed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Better readability and maintainability of code: By obscuring complicated implementation details, abstraction helps to make code simpler. The code becomes simpler to comprehend and work with by exposing only the fundamental properties and behaviors of an object or system. By making the code more readable, it becomes easier to maintain over time. Instead of getting bogged down in the intricate implementation details, developers may concentrate on the higher-level design and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Less difficult code thanks to abstraction: Instead of having to deal with low-level implementation details, abstraction enables developers to work with higher-level concepts and entities. As a result, the codebase is less complex and easier to manage. Developers may concentrate on the essential functionality and design by abstracting away superfluous complexity, which results in cleaner, more manageable code. The total development process is enhanced and the likelihood of mistakes and faults is decreased thanks to this simplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Better code reuse: Abstraction encourages the development of classes or components that can be used repeatedly. Developers can lay the groundwork for the construction of various objects or systems by establishing abstract classes or interfaces that offer a common set of behaviors. Multiple classes can extend or implement these abstract entities, allowing for code reuse and fostering a modular and scalable architecture. This not only speeds up development but also ensures consistency and lessens codebase redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. More adaptable code: The design and implementation of code are made more adaptable through abstraction. Changes to the underlying code can be done without having an impact on the higher-level code that depends on it by abstracting away particular implementation details. By encouraging loose coupling between components, the codebase is made more flexible and changeable in the future. Additionally, it makes maintenance and updates simpler because changes can be made locally on the appropriate abstract entities without affecting the entire codebase.\n",
